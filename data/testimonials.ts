        comments: 'My experience has been excellent. Moreover, whether you have a technical or non-technical background, I believe you will be able to understand the concepts taught by the professors, who, in my experience, are quite helpful and courteous. Even though the application is just a month old, it is already excellent. And I\'m looking forward to the remainder of my time here as a student. Hence, if someone is considering shifting careers to data science, I strongly advise them to do it; they will not be disappointed!!',

        comments: 'A good location to learn data science, AI, and machine learning. Trainers are extremely informed and very supportive in teaching the ideas. Data science training is built in such a manner that even a newbie may study every topic step by step, since the course is begun from scratch. The finest part of learning Data Science is their clarity on the programme, which is industry driven. Faculty are the finest in the business, with a wealth of knowledge. The support is excellent, and there is no possibility of getting lost along the route.',
